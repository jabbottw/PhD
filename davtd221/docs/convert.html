<h3>
Introduction</h3>
All "DaVince Tools" converters contain a number of common features. Common
<a href="#cli">command
line syntax</a>, <a href="#ini">initialization file use</a>, <a href="#profile">common
profile options</a> and a <a href="cmdfile.html">common scripting language</a>
allow for a user to become familiar with all converters easily and also
allows the tools to be easily integrated into the Windows interface application,
<a href="wdavince.html">wdavince.exe</a>.
<h3>
<a NAME="cli"></a>Common Command Line Syntax</h3>
The command line syntax for all the converters is the same:
<p><i>(Please note that the square brackets "[" and "]" specify optional
parameters; do not enter the brackets as part of the command)</i>
<p>converter [-1] [-c commandfile] [-f] [-i key:value [-i key:value]] [-o
outputfile] [-p profile] [-r] [-s] [-?] [file1 file2 ...]
<p><b>Arguments:</b>
<p>converter: The name of the converter: <a href="jpeg2pdf.html">jpeg2pdf</a>,
<a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a>
or <a href="txt2pdf.html">txt2pdf</a>
<p>-1: (numeric "one") Create one PDF file for each text file specified
on the command line (one to one relationship). For each TIFF file specified,
a PDF file is created in the same directory with the same name except with
a ".PDF" extension. A PDF file is not created if one already exists and
is newer than the corresponding text file. To force a PDF file to be created,
use the "-f" option. If "-1" or "-2" options are not used, then the default
is to take all specified files and combine them into a single PDF file
(many to one relationship). The behavior of the "-o" option changes when
using the "-1" option, as described below.
<p>-2: Create one PDF file for each subdirectory (many to few relationship).
For each directory specified on the command line, each subdirectory in
that directory is scanned and all text files in that subdirectory are converted
to a single PDF file. The behavior of the "-o" option changes when using
the "-2" option, as described below. If the "-r" (recursion) option is
used, then also convert all files in the subdirectory tree.
<p>-c: Process commands in the specified command file. When using this
argument, files and directories can be specified via a file instead of
on the command line. <a href="cmdfile.html">Click here</a> for more info
on command files.
<p>-f: When used with the "-1" option, force overwriting an existing PDF
file. By default, a PDF file may not be created with the "-1" option if
the TIFF file is unchanged since the last time the PDF file was created.
<p>-i: Specify Info dictionary attribute values like title and author of
document. The following attributes are available for use:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH="590" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="32%">
<center><b>Attribute</b></center>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="68%">
<center><b>Description</b></center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="32%">Author</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="68%">The name of the person who created the document.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="32%">Keywords</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="68%">Key words associated with the document.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="32%">Subject</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="68%">The subject of the document.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="32%">Title</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="68%">The title of the document.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the attribute names are case sensitive (first character in
uppercase). This option can be specified multiple times when setting multiple
dictionary attribute values. To specify an attribute along with its data,
separate the two with a colon ":". You will need to enclose the string
in quotes if there are spaces in the data. For example, to set the title
of a document to "The Declaration of Independence", use the following parameter:
<p>-i "Title:The Declaration of Independence"
<p>In addition to these tags, custom tags can be used with this option;
however, Acrobat Reader will not recognize them. The "CreationDate" and
"Creator" attributes are automatically filled in by the program and cannot
be overridden with this option.
<p>-o: Specify the PDF filename to create, or the directory to store the
newly created PDF if the "-1" or "-2" option is used. If a filename is
specified, the ".pdf" extension should be included. If this option is not
specified, the directory where the text files are found is used if the
"-1" or "-2" option is used, otherwise, the filename in the table below
in the current directory is assumed:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH="638" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Converter</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Default Filename</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>file2pdf (Plus version)</td>

<td>file.pdf</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">jpeg2pdf</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">jpeg.pdf</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">tiff2pdf</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">tiff.pdf</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">txt2df</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">text.pdf</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This option is required when converting files from CD ROM using either
the "-1" or "-2" options, since the default directory is not writeable.
<p>-p: Specify a profile to use in the creation of the PDF file. Profiles
contain conversion information such as margin and font settings and reside
in the "txt2pdf.ini" file located in either the directory where the executable
file resides or the windows base directory (typically "C:\WINDOWS" for
Windows 9x, "C:\WINDIR" for Windows NT). If the file is present in both
directories, the file located in the windows base directory takes precedence.
The default profile "default" is used when this option is not specified.
<p>-P: Specify a profile parameter on the command line. This allows one
to specify profile parameters without the need for a <a href="cmdfile.htm">command
file</a>. Specify the parameter in "key:value" format. Place quotes around
the parameter if spaces are in the value. This option may be specified
multiple times on the command line.
<p>-r: When a directory is specified, search subdirectories (recursive
search).
<p>-s: Sort the filenames specified on the command line in alphanumeric
order before processing them. Note that when a directory is specified on
the command line, files in that directory are always sorted.
<p>-?: A brief summary of arguments is displayed.
<p>[file1 file2 …]: Specify one or more files to convert. Wild card characters
such as "*" and "?" may be used.
<h3>
<a NAME="ini"></a>The Initialization File</h3>
The initialization file is a text file that stores one or more profiles
containing conversion options. This allows one to create a variety of profiles
with different conversion definitions. To specify a profile on the command
line, use the "-p" option. The profile can be picked easily from the Windows
interface program after the appropriate converter is chosen. From a DaVince
Command File, use the "profile" command to specify the profile.
<p>"DaVince Tools" recognizes two predefined profile names. The "default"
profile is used when no other profile name is specified. The "_common"
profile is used to define a parameter for all profiles. This profile is
applied prior to any other profile. This allows an option to be set globally.
For example, the following _common profile:
<p><tt>[_common]</tt>
<br><tt>annotationtext=The data contained in this file is the property
of ABC Inc.</tt>
<p>will by default create this text annotation on all profiles, unless
the option is overridden in a profile using the "annotationtext" option
with a different value.
<p>The profile name is enclosed in square brackets (i.e. "[default]"),
followed by a list of profile options. The profile name is case sensitive,
however, the profile options are not ("[default]" and "[Default]" are not
the same profile). Profile names like [_common], which begin with an underscore,
are hidden in the Windows interface program but are still valid profile
names. The following is an example of a profile definition:
<p><tt>[default]</tt>
<br><tt>description=Default Profile</tt>
<br><tt>bookmark=yes</tt>
<br><tt>openaction=fit</tt>
<br><tt>compression=yes</tt>
<p>Multiple profiles can exist in the file. The "-p" command line option
and the DaVince command file command "profile" determines which profile
the program will use. Profile names are case sensitive. If no profile is
specified on the command line, the default profile ("[default]") is used.
<p>Several options can appear after the profile line. These statements
have the following syntax:
<p>setting=value
<p>Where setting is the name of a valid setting (see below for a list of
common options) and "value" is the value for the setting. Depending on
the option, "value" can be a number, a string or a Boolean value. The following
values are all valid for a Boolean value:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH="460" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="42%"><b>Valid True Values</b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN="2" WIDTH="58%"><b>Valid False Values</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="42%">True, T, On, Enable, Yes, Y</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN="2" WIDTH="58%">False, F, Off, Disable, No, N</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These values are case insensitive (i.e. both "true" and "TRUE" are valid).
<p>Each converter uses its own initialization file. The name of this file
is the name of the converter with an ".INI" file extension. Thus for the
three converters,
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH="638" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><b>Converter Name</b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><b>Initialization Filename</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">jpeg2pdf.exe</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">jpeg2pdf.ini</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">tiff2pdf.exe</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">tiff2pdf.ini</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">txt2pdf.exe</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">txt2pdf.ini</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>The location of the initialization file is typically in the same directory
as the executable file. "DaVince Tools" ships with sample initialization
files for all converters in the "exe" directory, which contains both the
executable programs and the ".ini" files. The initialization file can also
be located in the Windows' directory (typically "c:\windows" for Windows
9X and "c:\winnt" for Windows NT/2000/XP). Putting the initialization file
in the Windows directory may make sense for those who want to use the same
profile options with multiple versions of the converter. The initialization
file in the Windows directory takes precedence if the file is found in
both directories.
<h3>
<a NAME="profile"></a>Common Profile Options</h3>
Although there are a number of unique profile options defined for each
converter, there is a large number of profile optons that are common to
all converters. These profile options are defined either in the .ini file
for the appropriate converter, defined in a DaVince Command File (DCF)
using the param statement (i.e. "param bookmark true) or defined on the
command line using the "-P" (uppercase P) option. The following table describes
these profile options (option names are case insensitive):
