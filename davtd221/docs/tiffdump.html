<p><b>Arguments:</b>
<p>-h: Display numeric values as hexadecimal
<p>-i ifdnum: Display only this IFD (default is to display all IFD’s)
<p>-?: A brief summary of arguments is displayed
<p>file: Specify the name of the TIFF file to generate a tag summary.

<h2>
Description:</h2>
"tiffdump" is a command line program that views the tag data structure
of a TIFF file. This program does not extract image data. To fully understand
the output of this program, you should be familiar with the TIFF file format.
For more information on the TIFF file data structure, refer to the TIFF
6 specification, which can be found at the Adobe web site http://www.adobe.com.
<p>By default, all image file directories (IFD’s) are displayed. Multiple
IFD’s are typically found in multi-page TIFF files and TIFF files with
attached thumbnail or mask images. If this is a multi IFD TIFF file, you
can display a selected IFD by using the "-i" option.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Other information displayed by the program:</h2>
CPU Byte Order: the byte order used by the hardware executing "tiffdump".
For Intel platforms, this value is "little" for little endian. For Macintosh,
Solaris and AIX platforms, this value is "big" for big endian.
<p>File Byte Order: the byte order used in the TIFF file. Typically it
is the same byte order as the computer that created the file, which may
not the same byte order of the computer reading the file. For example,
a TIFF file created on a Macintosh will have a file byte order of "Big",
and when reading this file on an Intel PC, the CPU byte order will be "Little".
