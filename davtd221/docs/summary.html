<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>DaVince Tools </b>is a group of programs for converting JPEG, TIFF and
text files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. These programs can
either be run from a Windows application or in a DOS command line environment.
As a bonus, included with the product is a TIFF tag viewer and a program
that creates 2-dimensional mazes in PDF. <b>DaVince Tools Plus</b> contains
all programs in <b>DaVince Tools</b> plus additional programs described
below. Both products are shipped together.&nbsp; Unless otherwise noted,
this documentation applies to both version of <b>DaVince Tools</b>.
<p>These are stand-alone programs, which means they are not plug-ins for
other applications nor do they require other software in order to run.
There is a converter for each file type. For example, "tiff2pdf" is used
to convert TIFF files to PDF. The Windows application, wdavince.exe, provides
a single interface for all the converters. This is the application most
users will use for converting files to PDF. A DOS command line environment
is also available, where program execution can be controlled by either
the command line or a command file. This environment is typically used
for automated or batch conversion. Each converter uses a configuration
".ini" file to store commonly used profiles. All converters use the same
command line syntax.
<p><b>Common Features</b>
<p>All converters share a significant amount of common features. Refer
to the "<a href="convert.html">DaVince Tools Converters</a>" for a detailed
summary of features common to all converters.
<p><b>DaVince Tools is Shareware</b>

<h2>
Take Your Pick: Windows, Command Line or DLL Interfaces</h2>
<b>DaVince Tools</b> offers the flexibility of running in several ways.&nbsp;
For users accustom to using Windows applications, the <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>
program offers a single Windows interface for accessing all of the converter
and bonus applications. It provides a convenient method of choosing the
appropriate converter and profile, as well as choosing the files and/or
directories to convert as well as various other conversion options.
<p>For users familiar with DOS and writing batch programs, the command
line interface may be the best interface for running the converters. It
allows more control in the conversion process and bypasses limits imposed
by the operating system on the length of a command line. It is also the
method developers choose when integrating <b>DaVince Tools</b> with other
applications (the Windows interface program, <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>,
interfaces with the converters by using dynamically created command files).
The converters can run using either command line parameters or command
file parameters. Command line parameters provide a quick and easy way of
running a converter by specifying all conversion options on the command
line. A command file is a scripting like language that uses a text file
containing commands on how the conversion is to be performed. This allows
full flexibility in the conversion process.
<p>A DLL interface is available for users who register for <b>DaVince Tools
Plus</b>.&nbsp; <b>DaVince Tools Plus</b> contains all the programs in
<b>DaVince
Tools</b>, plus, it also includes the <a href="file2pdf.html">file2pdf</a>
converter and access to the DaVince DLL Library, useful to programmers
wanting to create PDF files within their applications..
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Limitations of Unregistered Version</h2>
The unregistered versions of both <b>DaVince Tools</b> and <b>DaVince Tools
Plus</b> allow full use of all program features. Unregistered copies will
create an unregistered notice within the PDF file, and the Windows application
will notify the user of its unregistered status after each conversion.
If only <b>DaVince Tools</b> is registered, an unregistered notice will
still appear in PDF files created using <b>DaVince Tool Plus</b> applications.&nbsp;
This notice within the PDF file will disappear for all future conversions
after you register your copy <b>of DaVince Tools</b> or <b>DaVince Tools
Plus</b>.&nbsp; Previous conversions will have to be re-run using a registered
version of <b>DaVince Tools</b> or <b>DaVince Tools Plus</b> in order to
create a PDF file without the notice.

<h2>
