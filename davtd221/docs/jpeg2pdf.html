Description</h2>
"jpeg2pdf" is a command line program that converts JPEG files to PDF (Portable
Document Format) files (for a Windows interface to this program, see <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>).
JPEG is a file standard used primarily for photographic images. The program
takes the raw image data from the JPEG file "as is" and puts it in a PDF
wrapper. This analogous to removing a letter from a letter size envelope
and placing it in a business size envelope. The original image data is
unaltered, so no data compression of the image is done (although the page
description can be compressed using the "compression" option in the jpeg2pdf.ini
file). Since the image is transferred "as is" from the JPEG file to the
PDF file, this results in a fast conversion. The key features of this program
are:
<ul>
<li>
JPEG file formats JFIF and ITU T.81 supported</li>

<li>
Single and multi-page file support</li>

<li>
Bookmark support</li>

<li>
Convert many JPEG files to one PDF (many to one), create a PDF file for
each specified JPEG file (one to one), or create a PDF file for each JPEG
subdirectory specified (many to few)</li>

<li>
RGB, Grayscale and CMYK JPEG files supported</li>

<li>
Quick conversion of data by utilizing existing compressed image data</li>

<li>
Individual filenames with wildcard support and/or an entire directory may
be specified for conversion</li>

<li>
Specify files or directories to convert either via the command line or
a command file</li>

<li>
Large file support (1,000+ pages)</li>

<li>
Creates a version 1.2 PDF file with a unique file ID in trailer</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;The height, width and resolution information embedded in the JPEG
file are used to determine the physical page size. For example, an image
2,544 pixels wide and 3,287 pixels long and scanned at 300 DPI results
in a PDF page size of 2,544/300 by 3,287/300, or 8.48 inches wide by 10.96
inches long. The resulting page size may not match a standard paper size,
however, this is not a problem for viewers like Adobe Acrobat. The advantage
to this method is that a multiple page conversion can contain images scanned
at different sizes. This allows, for example, a converted PDF file to contain
both U.S. letter and legal size pages, as well as differing European sizes
(A1, A2, etc.) or even a combination of the two.
<p>The screen output can be redirected to a file adding the DOS syntax
">filename" to the end of the command line. This can be used to redirect
output to a log file. The program returns an error code of 1 when a fatal
error occurs, used in batch programs to test the success of the program.
<p>The initialization file and the use of profiles is described in the
<a href="convert.html">"DaVince
Tools" Converters</a> page.

A list of new features and changes, along with a version history, can be
found in the <a href="release.html#version">release notes.</a>
<h2>
<a NAME="information"></a>Additional Information:</h2>
Any DaVince Tool product that creates a PDF must create an intermediate
file prior to writing the PDF file. The filename of this intermediate file
begins with "tmps" and appears in the directory pointed to by the environment
variable "TMP". If this environment does not exist, then the temporary
file is written in the current directory. The intermediate file exists
only during the execution of the program.
