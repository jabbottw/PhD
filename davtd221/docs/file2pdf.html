<h2>
Description:</h2>
"file2pdf" is a command line program that converts TIFF, JPEG and text
files to PDF (Portable Document Format) files (for a Windows interface
to this program, see <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>). This program
is available only to <b>DaVince Tools Plus</b> users.&nbsp; The key features
of this program are:
<ul>
<li>
Combines all the features of <a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a>, <a href="jpeg2pdf.html">jpeg2pdf</a>
and <a href="txt2pdf.html">txt2pdf</a></li>

<li>
Create PDF files from multiple file types</li>

<li>
Utilizes the DaVince Tools DLL library, a PDF generating module that can
be utilized by programmers to add PDF generation to their programs.</li>

<li>
PDF file compression support</li>

<li>
Automatic bookmark creation option</li>

<li>
Convert many files to one PDF, a directory of files to one PDF, or create
a PDF file for each file</li>

<li>
Individual filenames with wildcard support and/or an entire directory may
be specified for conversion</li>

<li>
Specify files or directories to convert either via the command line or
a command file</li>

<li>
Large file support (1,000+ pages)</li>

</ul>
The initialization file and the use of profiles is described in the
<a href="convert.html">"DaVince
Tools" Converters</a> page. Since this converter combines the features
of <a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a>, <a href="jpeg2pdf.html">jpeg2pdf</a>
and <a href="txt2pdf.html">txt2pdf</a>, profile settings from these converters
can be combined into a single profile.Common profile settings as well as
converter specific settings can be used in a profile.
<h3>
Common Profile Settings</h3>
Refer to the <a href="convert.html">"DaVince Tools" Converters</a> page
for a description of the common profile settings.
<h3>
Converter Specific Settings</h3>
The special profile name "_converter" is used to define the converter to
use for each recognized file type. By default, the profile is defined as
follows:
<p>[_converter]
<br>tiff=tiff,tif
<br>jpeg=jpeg,jpg
<br>text=txt,ini,bat
<p>The default assigns the file types to the three converters. For example,
all files ending in ".txt" will be converted using the text converter.&nbsp;
If a file type is encountered that is not defined by any converter, it
is skipped. File types can be added to one of the converters if one wishes
to include them in conversion.
<p>A default profile is defined, however, most users will want to create
their own profiles that combine profile settings of other converters.

<a NAME="newfeatures"></a>New Features / Changes</h2>
A list of new features and changes, along with a version history, can be
found in the <a href="release.html#version">release notes.</a>
<h2>
<a NAME="information"></a>Additional Information:</h2>
Any tool that creates a PDF must create an intermediate file prior to writing
the PDF file. The filename of this intermediate file begins with "tmps"
and appears in the directory pointed to by the environment variable "TMP".
If this environment does not exist, then the temporary file is written
in the current directory. The intermediate file exists only during the
execution of the program.
