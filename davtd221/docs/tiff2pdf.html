<a NAME="syntax"></a>Command Syntax</h2>
Refer to the <a href="convert.html">"DaVince Tools" Converters</a> page
for a description of the command line syntax for all converters.
<h2>
<a NAME="description"></a>Description</h2>
"tiff2pdf" is a command line program that converts TIFF (Tagged Image File
Format) files to PDF (Portable Document Format) files (for a Windows interface
to this program, see <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>). The program
can convert a TIFF file by either recompressing the data for PDF use or
taking the raw image data from the file "as is" and putting it into a PDF
wrapper when possible. This analogous to removing a letter from a letter
size envelope and placing it in a business size envelope. The original
image data is unaltered, so no data recompression is required (not all
TIFF raw image data is compatible with PDF; these files will automatically
be recompressed). The key features of this program are:
<ul>
<li>
TIFF compression modes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 32773 support</li>

<li>
Single and multi-strip file support</li>

<li>
Tiled TIFF file support</li>

<li>
Single and multi-page file support</li>

<li>
Monochrome, grayscale and color (indexed, RGB and CMYK) image support</li>

<li>
Thumbnail and bookmark support</li>

<li>
Convert many TIFF files to one PDF (many to one), create a PDF file for
each specified TIFF file (one to one), or create a PDF file for each TIFF
subdirectory specified (many to few)</li>

<li>
Individual filenames with wildcard support and/or an entire directory may
be specified for conversion</li>

<li>
Specify files or directories to convert either via the command line or
a command file</li>

<li>
Large file support (1,000+ pages)</li>

<li>
Compatible with Acrobat Capture for OCR conversion of image data</li>

<li>
Creates a version 1.2 PDF file with a unique file ID in trailer</li>

<li>
Quick conversion of data option uses existing compressed image data in
PDF file, resulting in faster conversion time</li>

<li>
Archive conversion of data option recompresses image data creating smaller
PDF files in many cases</li>
</ul>
The following TIFF tags are required in order for the file to be converted.
If any of these tags are missing, the application will skip over the image.
The "<a href="tiffdump.html">tiffdump</a>" program, part of <a href="summary.html">DaVince
Tool set</a>, can be used to display the tags of a TIFF file.

<p>The height, width and resolution tags are used to determine the physical
page size. For example, an image 2,544 pixels wide and 3,287 pixels long
and scanned at 300 DPI results in a PDF page size of 2,544/300 by 3,287/300,
or 8.48 inches wide by 10.96 inches long. The resulting page size may not
match a standard paper size, however, this is not a problem for viewers
like Adobe Acrobat. The advantage to this method is that a multiple page
conversion can contain images scanned at different sizes. This allows,
for example, a converted PDF file to contain both U.S. letter and legal
size pages, as well as differing European sizes (A1, A2, etc.) or even
a combination of the two.
<p>The screen output can be redirected to a file adding the DOS syntax
">filename" to the end of the command line. This can be used to redirect
output to a log file. The program returns an error code of 1 when a fatal
error occurs, used in batch programs to test the success of the program.
<p>The initialization file and the use of profiles is described in the
<a href="convert.html">"DaVince
Tools" Converters</a> page. In addition to the default profile, the following
sample profiles are defined in the tiff2pdf.ini file that ships with the
program:

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="23%">Bool</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">When true, compress image data in an optimal
manner. When archive option is set to true, converted page indicator is
a plus sign ("+"). When archive option is set to false, converted page
indicator is a period ("."). Archive mode is automatically turned on for
image formats that are not supported natively in PDF (PackBits and CCITT
Group 3 with unsupported Group 3 options are examples). The default is
false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">DamagedRowCount</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="23%">Number</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">This parameter is used when a TIFF file was
received from a Group 3 Facsimili device and contains transmission errors.
Setting this parameter to a positive number will allow the PDF reader to
accept files with damaged rows up to this value. A value of "1" or "2"
may be sufficient for most users. This parameter is only used with Group
3 files. Group 4 files are not affected. This option is not used when "archive"
is set to true. By default, this value is "0" (no damaged rows allowed).</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">DefaultDPI</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="23%">Number (in DPI)</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">Default resolution to use if resolution tag

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="23%">Number (in MB)</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">Maximum image size (in megabytes) in the PDF

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="23%">Bool</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="38%">When true, make image background transparent,
useful with other programs that create watermarks. When false, make image
background opaque. If using Acrobat Capture for OCR conversion with the
resulting PDF file, this must be set to false. The default value is false.</td>

<h2>
Problem TIFF Files:</h2>
Not all TIFF files can be converted with this application. One should verify
the correctness of the conversion by viewing the PDF file with a PDF viewer.
Listed below are reasons why a TIFF file may not be converted:
<ul>
<li>
Monochrome, gray scale and color TIFF files with compression mode 1 (uncompressed),
2 (Huffman), 3 (CCITT Group 3), 4 (CCITT Group 4) or 32773 (Packbits),
are supported. Mode 5 compression (LZW), typically used for compressing
color images, is supported only when "archive" is set to false. Indexed,
RGB and CMYK color images are supported. JPEG compressed TIFF files are
not supported.</li>

<li>
The following TIFF tags are required: ImageLength, ImageWidth, Compression,
StripOffsets/TileOffsets and StripByteCounts/TileByteCounts. Most TIFF
reading applications require these tags.</li>

<li>
Starting with version 1.1, the TIFF tag FillOrder is supported. Versions
of tiff2pdf prior to version 1.1 will not convert these files.</li>

<li>
Not all CCITT compressed images can be copied to the PDF file unaltered.
In particular, compressed images containing the T4Option tag with bit 2
set can not be converted as-is, since there is no equivalent T4 option
in the PDF specification. tiff2pdf will recompress this image if it detects
this bit is set (Note: releases of tiff2pdf prior to version 2 generated
an error). For a technical description about bit 2 in the T4Option tag,
the TIFF 6 Specification describes it as follows:</li>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>Bit 2 is 1 if fill bits have been added as necessary before EOL codes
such that EOL always ends on a byte boundary, thus ensuring an EOL-sequence
of 1 byte preceded by a zero nibble: xxxx-0000 0000-0001.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<li>
Certain TIFF files generated with version 1.1.0 of tiff2pdf generated a
"Read less image data than expected" error in Acrobat Reader and Exchange.
This problem was fixed in version 1.1.1. If you still receive this error
when using version 1.1.1 or later of tiff2pdf, then the image data may
be at fault. Certain programs (typically older programs) that create TIFF
files truncate the bottom of the page if there is no image data to display.
Specifying an image height and then storing image data of a lesser height
does not conform to industry practices and Acrobat complains about it.
tiff2pdf also complains about it when generating a thumbnail for this image.
Acrobat still allows viewing and printing of this image despite the error.
To remove the error message you should recompress the image data by using
a profile with the archive option enabled</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="information"></a>Additional Information:</h2>
Any DaVince Tool product that creates a PDF must create an intermediate
file prior to writing the PDF file. The filename of this intermediate file
begins with "tmps" and appears in the directory pointed to by the environment
variable "TMP". If this environment does not exist, then the temporary
file is written in the current directory. The intermediate file exists
only during the execution of the program.
