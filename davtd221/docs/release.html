without errors but would generate errors in the PDF viewer application.
<p>December 13, 2001 - (2.0.0 Final) <b>All converters:</b> new "_common"
profile, used to set default settings for all profiles for a particular
converter. <b>tiff2pdf</b>: program now correctly skips over TIFF thumbnails

<p>November 16, 2001 - (2.0.0 Beta 3) <b>wdavince</b>: Added customizable
tool menu feature, which can be used for running batch programs or launch
other applications (tiffdump and pdfmaze are included in the default menu).

<b>txt2pdf</b>:
Green bar feature now works correctly when converting files 1 to 1.
<p>October 30, 2001 - (2.0.0 Beta 2) <b>New program</b>: wdavince, a Windows
application for PDF conversion. Features include support for drag and drop
file conversion, saving parameters in command file format, and automatic
opening of newly created PDF file. <b>All converters(jpeg2pdf, tiff2pdf
and txt2pdf):</b> fixed bug where PDF filename would be incorrect when
converting files "1 to 1" and the original data file had a filename extension
other than three characters long. <b>All programs</b>: The registration
key file can now be stored in the same directory as the executable file
in addition to the Windows directory. All "DaVince Tools" files can now
be stored in a single directory structure (installation in the Windows
directory is no longer required). <b>jpeg2pdf</b>: gray scale JPEG's now
work.
<p>August 28, 2001- (2.0.0 Beta 1) <b>All programs</b>: All .ini files
can now be stored in the same directory as the executable file. This is
an addition to the previous method of locating the .ini files in the Windows
directory. If an ini file exists in both directories, the Windows directory
takes precedence. As a result, the "INI" directory in the installation
has been eliminated and all .ini files have been moved to the "EXE" directory.
Refer to the <a href="#installation">installation instructions</a> for
more discussion on this topic. <b>All converters(jpeg2pdf, tiff2pdf and
txt2pdf): </b>New command file options: create, echo, info, and param.
All command line options can now be specified within the command file.
Profile options can now be individually set in the command file. <b>txt2pdf</b>:
All font options now take an optional encoding parameter to allow for international
character sets. New BarWizard option creates a "green bar" background on
the page typically seen in legacy reports. New custom paper size option
allows for non-standard paper sizes. New "legacy" wrap mode for FORTRAN
and COBOL generated reports. <b>tiff2pdf:</b> Color (indexed, RGB and CMYK)
and grayscale images supported (including thumbnails). Compression modes
None, and PackBits are now supported. New archive mode option to force
recompression of image data.
<p>March 14, 2001- (1.3.0) <b>New program</b>: jpeg2pdf, use to convert
JPEG files to PDF. <b>All programs:</b> Fixed memory leak when writing
the PDF file. This was most noticeable when creating a large PDF file or
creating many PDF's with the "-1" option. Fixed date problem in document
info, which occurred in timezones east of GMT, and in timezones where the
minute offset from GMT was not zero. Fixed bug in page buffering. It was
found to occur in txt2pdf when a single page was slightly greater than
8 KB in size, but it possibly could have occurred in other programs. Fixed
a problem where a "deflate" error message could occur when compressing
a page.<b> All converters(jpeg2pdf, tiff2pdf and txt2pdf):</b> All converters
now support the same command line syntax, allowing, for example, one to
one or many to one file conversions. Previously, txt2pdf, lacked many of
the command line options that tiff2pdf supported. New command line option
"-c" allows for specifying files, directories and .ini profile names from
a command file instead of the command line. Bookmark names can be specified
in the command file, instead of using the filename as the default bookmark
name. Added "BookmarkFilenameExtension" parameter to .ini file. When set
to true, bookmarks retain their filename extension, otherwise, the filename
extension is dropped when the bookmark is created. For example, a filename
of "README.TXT" will appear as "README" when set to false. The default
setting is false. Added "OpenAction" parameter to .ini file. This parameter
describes how to view the first page of the newly created PDF file when
opened. Choices are "Fit" to fit entire page, "FitH" to fit the horizontal
width of the page, "FitV" to fit the vertical width of the page, or "None",
which defaults to the setting defined in the PDF viewer. The default setting
is "None". Pressing Control-C to abort the program now cleans up all temporary
files. Fixed bug when specifying both "-1" and "-r" options, converter
would not descend into directories 2 levels or more down. <b>txt2pdf only:</b>
Added "FileMatch" parameter to .ini file. This parameter allows setting
a default file match pattern when specifying a directory. By default, this
value is "*.txt,*.bat,*.ini". "Pagetrim" now works with files over 50 pages.
<b>tiff2pdf
only:</b> Fixed bug in CCITT uncompression (used in creating thumbnails).
This bug would erroneously complain about bad data or an unsupported compression
mode occasionally. Added "FileMatch" parameter to .ini file. This parameter
allows setting a default file match pattern when specifying a directory.
By default, this value is "*.tif,*.tiff". Added "DamagedRowCount" parameter
to .ini file. This parameter is used when the TIFF file was received from
a Group 3 Facsimile device and contains transmission errors. Setting this
parameter to a positive number will allow the PDF reader to accept files
with damaged rows up to this value. A value of "1" or "2" may be sufficient
for most users. This parameter is only used with Group 3 files. Group 4
files are not affected. By default, this value is "0" (no damaged rows
allowed).
<p>October 11, 2000- (1.2.0) <b>all program:</b> All program messages now
consistently go to stdout, used to redirect output to a log file. All programs
now return an error code of 1 when a fatal error occurs, used in batch
programs to test the success of the program. <b>tiffdump:</b> Tiff reading
routine is now more robust when encountering unknown data types. <b>txt2pdf:</b>
Added page trim option to remove blank pages from either the front or back
or both. Use "PageTrim=front|back|both|none" in the ini file to enable.
<b>tiff2pdf:</b>
Tiff reading routine is now more robust when encountering unknown data
types. Added transparency option (must be disabled for Acrobat Capture
use). Use "Transparency=true" in ini file to enable image transparency
(default is false). Group 3/4 images using uncompressed mode no longer
crash the program (an error is generated instead, since this is not yet
supported). The "-o" option now works with -1 to provide an alternate output
directory. Fixed memory leak when -1 was used with many files. Fixed memory
leak when thumbnails were generated. Tiled tiff images can now be converted
using tiff2pdf. When converting a directory, the program now looks for
files ending in ".tiff" in addition to ".tif".
<p>July 5, 2000- (1.1.1) Maintenance release. <b>all programs</b>: a new
C++ compiler version is now used, which has increased performance and reduced
the overall file size of all programs. <b>tiff2pdf:</b> Fixed problem with
"-r" (recursion) option; thumbnails are now generated for certain TIFF
files that displayed a thumbnail error in previous release. Fixed problem
where certain converted TIFF files generated a "read less image data than
expected" error in Acrobat (see the <a href="tiff2pdf.html#problem">"Problem
TIFF files</a>" section in the <a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a> documentation
for further discussion). <b>txt2pdf</b>: Fixed problem where program aborted
when form feeds were at the beginning of a file; bookmarks now point to
the correct page; ASCII characters in the 128 to 255 range no longer give
an error message.
<p>March 20, 2000 - (1.1.0) Major enhancements made to <a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a>
and <a href="txt2pdf.html">txt2pdf</a>. Enhancements to tiff2pdf include
thumbnail, bookmark and one to one Tiff to PDF options. Like txt2pdf, tiff2pdf
now has an initialization file for these options, named "tiff2pdf.ini".
Enhancments to txt2pdf include customizable header and footer, bookmark
and full justification options. Documentation changes reflect new web domain:
<a href="http://www.davince.com/">www.davince.com</a>.
<p>November 5, 1999 - (1.0 B2) now works with Windows NT, environment variable
"WINDIR" is now used instead of "WINBOOTDIR" when looking for the Windows
directory in order to be compatible with both NT and Windows 9x.
<p>October 28, 1999 - (1.0 B1) initial release

<p><b>For users upgrading from a previous release</b>: If you have modified
your <b>DaVince Tools</b> initialization files in your Windows directory,
do not copy over the newer release initialization files, otherwise, you
will lose your changes. Make note of the new features in the initialization
files and add them to your existing files.
<p>To install <b>DaVince Tools</b>:
<p>Create a new directory on your hard drive and unzip the files into this
directory. You can find unzip shareware utilities at <a href="http://www.pkware.com/">http://www.pkware.com</a>
and at <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com</a>. If you
want to run the programs from the command line instead of the Windows application
wdavince, add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<p>PATH=toolsdirectory\EXE;%PATH%
<p>Where "toolsdirectory" is the location where <b>DaVince Tools</b> was
installed on your hard drive.
<p>You can optionally copy the .ini files stored in the "EXE" directory
to your Windows directory, although this is no longer a requirement beginning
with version 2.0. Placing them in the Windows directory may be useful if
you store "DaVince Tools" on a network drive. The .ini files stored in
the "EXE" directory will be made available to your network users as a default.
If they wish to customize the .ini files, they should copy them to their
local Windows directory, which will take precedence over the .ini files
on the network drive. Note that each network user is considered a separate
user for licensing purposes. You may also wish to use the Windows directory
location if you have made extensive changes to the .ini files and wish
to use the same .ini files when upgrading to a newer release of "DaVince
Tools".
<p>Any "DaVince Tools" application that creates a PDF file will create
a temporary file for storage of the page data. This temporary file is created
in the directory pointed to by the "TMP" environment variable. If this
environment variable does not exist, then the temporary file is created
in the current directory (note: the Windows interface program, wdavince.exe,
will automatically set this variable to the same string as the "TEMP" environment
variable if "TMP" has not been set). Use of this environment variable is
strongly suggested in a network environment, where writing the temporary
file on a network drive can cause performance degradation. Check to see
if "TMP" is defined by typing "SET" at the command prompt and look for
a line starting "TMP=…". If not set, you can use the Windows temporary
directory by adding the following line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<p>SET TMP=C:\WINNT\TEMP
<p>This example assumes that your Windows home directory is "C:\WINNT".
<p>When installing <b>DaVince Tools</b>, note that the version of the converters
should match the version of the Windows application wdavince. Mixing different
versions of the converters with wdavince can cause the converters to behave
incorrectly and it is not a recommended configuration. The version of wdavince
can be found in the "About DaVince Tools…" option in the help menu. The
version of a converter can be found by using the "-?" command line option.
<h2>
<a NAME="knownissues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
When running <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a> with a 16 bit version
of Windows (i.e. Windows 95/98/ME), the conversion output window is limited
to 64,000 characters. Conversion will continue past this point but the
window output will not be displayed.
<p>If your mazes generated with <a href="pdfmaze.html">pdfmaze</a> print
with thick lines in Acrobat, try using the "print as image" option when
printing. This problem is not related to the PDF file, but may be your
printer driver.
<p>Multi-strip TIFF files converted to PDF using the <a href="tiff2pdf.html">tiff2pdf</a>
program with the "Archive" option disabled may not download from the Internet
correctly when using Acrobat as a browser plug-in. The symptom of this
problem is the error message "Read less image data than expected" is displayed
after downloading the image and various strips may not display correctly.
Enabling the "archive" option, or saving the file to the hard drive first
and then displaying the file locally corrects this problem.
<p>Abnormal termination of an application that creates a PDF file may not
delete the temporary file used for storing page data. You may want to delete
these files to free up disk space. These files begin with "TMPS" and reside
in the directory pointed to by the TMP environment variable, or reside
in the current directory if TMP is not defined. Note that beginning with
version 1.3, pressing Control-C to cancel the program within DOS now removes
the temporary files.
