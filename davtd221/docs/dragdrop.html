<p>Drag and drop conversion is available in the <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a>
application, the Windows interface to the "DaVince Tools" converters. Files
and directories within the application, as well as files and directories
from the Windows desktop can be dragged and dropped into the application.
Refer to the <a href="wdavince.html">wdavince</a> documentation for more
information on the drag and drop features of this application. This article
describes configuring drag and drop for a specific converter without using
the wdavince application.
<p>Despite the DOS nature of the <b>DaVince Tools</b> converters, you can
drag and drop JPEG, TIFF and text files from the Windows desktop to convert
them to PDF. You can also drag and drop directories containing these files.
The secret to this is to create a shortcut on the desktop for the appropriate
DaVince Tools converter. The procedure for this varies depending on which
version of Windows you are using, due to differences in shortcut functionality.
The main difference is that Windows 2000 (and hopefully its successors)
supports the use of command line options with drag and drop in the shortcut
definition. With the other tested Windows flavors, 95/98/NT/ME, command
line options in the shortcut definition were ignored when drag and drop
was used. With this in mind, the following procedures were developed.
<h2>
Drag and Drop Configuration in Windows 95/98/NT/ME</h2>
A batch file will need to be created for each converter and profile combination
you wish to use for drag and drop. The batch file will also need to accept
parameters, which will be used to "drop" the files into it. . For example,
if you installed <b>DaVince Tools</b> in the "c:\dosapps\davince" directory,
the following batch file "txt80x60.bat" can be used to convert text files
using the "fixed-80x60" profile:
<p><tt>@echo off</tt>
<br><tt>c:\dosapps\davince\exe\txt2pdf.exe -p "fixed-80x60" -1 -o .\ %1
%2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</tt>
<br><tt>pause</tt>
<p>Note that file above is 3 lines long, and the txt2pdf.exe line is not
entered as two lines. The "-o" option tells the converter to place the
PDF files in the current directory, which in fact is the working directory
specified in the shortcut. Batch files support up to 9 parameters at a
time, so you are limited to dragging up to 9 files and/or directories at
a time.
<p>The shortcut will have at least the command line and the working directory
fields filled in. The command line will contain the batch file created
as outlined above, and the working directory will point to the directory
where the newly created PDF files will be placed. This could be a folder
on your desktop, where you can easily retrieve the converted files.
<p>You can drag not only single files, but also multiple files or directories
into the shortcut. You will either get a single PDF file, or many PDF files
in your working directory depending on if the "-1" option is used.
<h2>
Drag and Drop Configuration in Windows 2000</h2>
The shortcut will contain the complete command line syntax for the appropriate
program without the JPEG, TIFF or text filename. You can have one shortcut
for "one to one conversion" and another for "many to one" conversion (version
1.3 of txt2pdf now supports "one to one" conversion). The shortcut should
have at least the command line and the working directory fields filled
in. The command line will contain the <b>DaVince Tools</b> command and
the working directory will point to the directory where the resulting PDF
files will reside. The working directory will be where the newly created
PDF files are placed. This could be a folder on your desktop, where you
can easily retrieve the converted files. For example, if you installed
<b>DaVince Tools</b> in the "c:\dosapps\davince" directory, the command
line for converting text files using the "fixed-80x60" profile is:
<dir>
<dir><tt>c:\dosapps\davince\exe\txt2pdf.exe -p "fixed-80x60" -1 -o .\</tt></dir>
</dir>
Your command line will vary depending on where <b>DaVince Tools</b> is
installed. The "-o" option above tells the converter to place the PDF files
in the current directory, which in fact is the working directory specified
in the shortcut.
<p>You can drag not only single files, but also multiple files or directories
into the shortcut. You will either get a single PDF file, or many PDF files
in your working directory depending on if the "-1" option is used.
