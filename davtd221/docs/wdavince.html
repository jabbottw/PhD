<h2>
Description</h2>
<b>wdavince</b> is a Windows application used for converting files to PDF.
It creates a GUI interface for both "DaVince Tools" and "DaVince Tools
Plus". The features of this application include:
<ul>
<li>
A single GUI interface for use with all "DaVince Tools"/"DaVince Tools
Plus" converters and add-on programs</li>

<li>
Drag and drop files and/or directories for conversion, either from within
the application or from the Windows desktop</li>

<li>
Use the GUI interface for converting files or creating DaVince Command
Files (DCF) for future conversions</li>

<li>
Run previously saved DCF files</li>

<li>
Graphically choose converter and profile to use for conversion</li>

<li>
Convert files in a watched folder</li>

<li>
Profile names are displayed along with their description</li>

<li>
Automatically launch the PDF viewer after conversion (all files/many to
one conversion only)</li>

<li>
Conversion output is in scrollable window and can easily be copied to the
clipboard</li>

<li>
Application settings are automatically maintained between sessions</li>

<li>
Customizable tools menu allows for running other applications like tiffdump
and pdfmaze</li>

<li>
Tip of the day and on-line documentation available from the Help menu</li>

<li>
Link to home page and registration information available from the Help
menu</li>
</ul>
"DaVince Tools Plus" settings can be enabled or disabled using the menu
option in the tools menu. Enabling these "Plus" settings adds the file2pdf
converter to the converters list as well as adds the DLL sample programs
to the tools menu. Enabling the "Plus" settings only displays these options,
it does not change the registration status. You still need to register
"DaVince Tools Plus" if you decide to use this program and remove the unregistered
annotations that may appear in the "Plus" applications.

<h2>
How to Specify Files or Folders for Conversion</h2>
There are several ways in which a file or folder can be specified for conversion:
<ul>
<li>
Double click files in the file list box in the upper right corner of the
application window.</li>

<li>
Drag and drop files from the file list box or the folder box to the conversion
box at the lower right corner of the application.</li>

<li>
Drag files or folders from the desktop or another window to the application
window.</li>

<li>
Drag files or folders from the desktop or another window to the application's
shortcut, if available.</li>
</ul>
Files and folders listed in the conversion box can be reordered by dragging
and dropping them from within the same window. Files and folders can be
removed from the conversion box by clicking on them and pressing the &lt;Delete>
key, or right clicking on them and choosing the delete option from the
popup menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The output of a sample conversion appears below:
<p><img SRC="convert.gif" height=375 width=401>
<h2>
&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>
Using the Watch Folders Feature</h2>
The watch folders feature can be accessed by either selecting the item
under the run menu or by clicking on the appropriate button in the button
bar. The watch folder window appears as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="watch.gif" height=498 width=373>
<p>This feature allows one to have a folder watched for incoming files.
As files appear in one or more defined folders, they are converted to PDF
using the specified converter and profile.&nbsp; For a frequently watched
folder, the settings can be saved to a DCF file using the "Save…" button.
This allows the folder to be watched later by using the "Run Command File…"
menu option and specifying this DCF file. After conversion, the original
file can be moved from the watch folder to the PDF folder, it can be deleted,
or it can be left alone.
<p>Under the "Edit" menu, the single option "Reset Fields" resets all fields
(except the watch folders field) to the original settings.
<h2>
Limitations of the Unregistered Version</h2>
The unregistered version of "DaVince Tools" allows full use of all program
features. Unregistered copies will create an unregistered notice within
the PDF file, and the Windows application will notify the user of its unregistered
status after each conversion. This notice within the PDF file will disappear
for all future conversions after you register your copy of "DaVince Tools".
Previous conversions will have to be re-run in order to remove the unregistered
notice. You are encouraged to register your software by clicking on the
"Register" menu item under the "Help" menu.
<h2>
Customizing the Tools Menu</h2>
The Tools menu is completely customizable. It can also be removed from
the application if desired. The Tools menu is defined in the wdavince.ini
file. It is located in the "[toolsmenu]" section. To remove the tools menu,
rename the "[toolsmenu]" name or delete the section in its entirety (for
example: "[_toolsmenu]"). Below is a sample line from the "[toolsmenu]"
section:
<p><tt>010=title:"TIFF Dump",exe:"tiffdump.exe %i",inputext:tif,input:"TIFF
file(*.tif,*.tiff)|*.tif;*.tiff",params:"console,open"</tt>
<p>The first parameter in the line ("010") specifies the ordering sequence
of
the item in the Tools menu. The actual value is not important, but its
ordering sequence is important. The ordering sequence is based on the alphanumeric
sorting sequence of the items and does not need to be sequential. Alphanumeric
sorting requires leading zeros in numbers. This means a sequence value
of "15" would appear before a value of "3", but not "03".
<p>The sequence value is followed by an equals sign ("="). This is then
followed by a series of comma delimited parameters used for defining the
menu item. The following parameters are allowed for defining the tool menu
item:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH="638" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">title</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The title to use in the menu. Create the shortcut
character by inserting an ampersand character (&amp;) before the shortcut
character. To create a separator bar in the menu, use a single dash as
its title ("-")</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">exe</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The filename of a data file or executable file
with any associated parameters. It should be located either in the "DaVince
Tools" exe directory, or it should be in the path, otherwise, the full
pathname must be specified. Single quotes should surround the data file
or executable file name if the path contains spaces.&nbsp; If an executable
file name is used and an input file parameter is expected, use "%i" in
the command line. If the command expects an output file to be specified,
use "%o" in the command line. The "%i" and "%o" options will fill in the
input and output filenames on the command line by displaying the appropriate
file dialog box to the user.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>priority</td>

<td>Priority value for the converter. Priority is used to when guessing
the converter to use when none has been specified and a file has just been
dropped into the conversion window.&nbsp; If two or more converters share
a common file type, the converter with the higher priority will be chosen
over one with a lower priority. For example, both tiff2pdf and file2pdf
convert tiff files. If tiff2pdf has a higher priority specified, then it
will be chosen over file2pdf.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">input</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The filter definition to be used in the open
dialog box.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">inputext</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The default file extension to be used with the
input file.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">output</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The filter definition to be used in the save
dialog box.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">outputext</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">The default file extension when creating the
output file, which is used by the save dialog box.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">params</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Additional comma delimited parameters that can
be used to define the behavior of the tool. This item must be enclosed
in quotes since it uses the same delimiter. These parameters are:&nbsp;
<p>console - Run the tool in the "DaVince Tools" console window.&nbsp;
<p>open - open the output file with its default viewer. For example, a
PDF file will be opened by Acrobat Reader or Exchange. When using the open
parameter with "exe" parameter, you must include the "%o" option in order
for this to work. To open an existing file (i.e. a previously created PDF
file), include the inputext and input parameters (the exe parameter is
not needed).&nbsp; Snother way to open an existing file is to include the
inputext, input and exe parameter of "%i" (the params parameter is not
needed in this case).</td>
